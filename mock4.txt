4. Save to HDFS: /user/<your_username>/mocks/mock4/problem1

2.	Problem Statement
Using sqoop do the following. Read the entire steps before you create the sqoop job.
	create a hive table in database named snehaananthan_retail_db_txt using below command
	create table products_hive  (product_id int, product_category_id int, product_name string, product_description string, product_price float, product_imaage string,product_grade int,  product_sentiment string);
	create a sqoop job Import retail_export.products_<your_username> table as hive import to database named <your_username>_retail_db_txt and table products_hive.
	insert three more records to retail_export.products_<your_username> from mysql
	run the sqoop job again so that only newly added records can be pulled from mysql

3.	Problem Statement
Using sqoop do the following. .

Problem Scenario 33 : You have given a files as below. 
/user/<your_username>/mocks/data/EmployeeName.csv
/user/<your_username>/mocks/data/EmployeeSalary.csv

Now write a Spark code which will load these two files from hdfs and join the same, and produce the (name,salary) values. 
Sort the records by salary and then by name in natural order and save as sequence file gzip compressed in /user/<your_username>/mocks/mock4/problem4

5.	Problem Statement
Problem Scenario 35 : You have been given a file named 
/user/<your_username>/mocks/data /EmployeeName.csv

Load this file from hdfs and sort it by name. 
Save it back as -
name id 
in /user/<your_username>/mocks/mock4/problem5 directory as text file. 
However, make sure while saving it should be able to write in a single file.

Problem Scenario 36 : You have been given a file named /user/<your_username>/mocks/data/data.csv  
(type, name)
Load this file from hdfs and save it back as (id, (all names of same type separated by tab-space)) in /user/<your_username>/mocks/mock4/problem6 directory as sequence file.
However, make sure while saving it should be able to write in a single file.

Problem Scenario 40 : You have been given sample data as below in a file called 
/user/<your_username>/mocks/data/veteran.txt

id,year,cadre,subdivision,country,state,honors,badges,age

Calculate the total badges procured by age groups 20-29, 30-39, 40-59. 
Also consider blank values for badges as 0. 
Save output: 
age_group, badges 
in parquet format snappy compressed to /user/<your_username>/mocks/mock4/problem9
